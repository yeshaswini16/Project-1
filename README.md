Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the average fuel consumption of vehicles based on input features such as engine size, weight, number of cylinders, and other vehicle specifications. The goal is to assist vehicle owners, manufacturers, and engineers in understanding the fuel efficiency of their vehicles and identifying areas of improvement.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains data on various vehicle attributes and their corresponding fuel consumption. You can access the dataset here (if available).

Some key attributes of the dataset include:

Engine Size: The size of the engine in liters.
Weight: The weight of the vehicle in kilograms.
Cylinders: The number of cylinders in the engine.
Fuel Type: Type of fuel used (e.g., petrol, diesel).
Mileage: The distance traveled per unit of fuel (miles per gallon, mpg).
Transmission Type: Automatic or manual transmission.
Features
Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature scaling, handling missing values.
Modeling: Machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.
Evaluation: Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.


Model
The machine learning model used in this project is based on [insert model, e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest]. The model was trained on the dataset and optimized using hyperparameter tuning techniques.

Results
The model's performance was evaluated using several metrics, including:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): [Insert result]
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): [Insert result]
R-Squared: [Insert result]
The model provides a reasonable prediction of fuel consumption, with an accuracy of [Insert result]%.
